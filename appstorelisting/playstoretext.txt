CENO (Censorship.No!) is a mobile web browser. It uses peer-to-peer technology to deliver websites to your phone and caches popular content with cooperating peers. CENO can be used to bypass Internet censorship and help others retrieve blocked pages. 

Say NO to censorship! Install CENO Browser today and be prepared for the next time you get 🔌 unplugged. 

🚫🌴 Offline-first.
CENO is designed with internet shutdown scenarios in mind. Websites are shared by a global network of peers, and stored in a distributed cache for availability when traditional networks are blocked or go down.

🔓👀 Unlock the web.
Access any website. Frequently requested content is cached on the network and cannot be forcibly removed. 

💲🌐 Reduce Data Costs.
By routing user traffic through peer-to-peer networks, CENO Browser incurs less data costs while still providing users with circumvention capability.

📖👐 Free and open source.
CENO Browser is powered by Ouinet, an open source library enabling third party developers to incorporate the CENO network into their apps for peer-to-peer connectivity.

Please note: CENO browser is experimental software. We offer it with the best intention that it is useful to you, but due to its highly innovative nature and stage of development, you may expect some issues while using it. 

CENO is not an anonymity tool: information about your browsing might be leaked to other CENO users, as well as the fact that your application is providing particular web content to others. Content accessed with the application may stay in storage in clear text for some time. Other security or privacy-affecting issues might exist.

We recommend that you use this tool in controlled environments and only assume reasonable risks. eQualitie and its associates decline any legal responsibility derived from the use of this software.
