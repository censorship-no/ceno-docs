msgid ""
"This section will give you some hints about what to do when different, known"
" problems arise with CENO and Ouinet. Please bear in mind that these are "
"experimental projects, and that their operation is subject to a multitude of"
" factors beyond our control, like the particular configuration and status of"
" network infrastructure, as well as which content other users have retrieved"
" and the characteristics of their connections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If problems still persist, please report them to "
"[cenoers@equalit.ie](mailto:cenoers@equalit.ie). We will try to help you "
"with them."
msgstr ""

msgid "There is no CENO entry in the app menu"
msgstr ""

msgid "The CENO Extension may still be loading. Please be patient."
msgstr ""

msgid "All widgets are grayed-out in the *CENO Settings* page"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The CENO Extension has loaded, but it has not yet been able to retrieve "
"status from Ouinet. Since it may take a moment for Ouinet to be ready, "
"please be patient."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the Settings page stays like that after more than two minutes, Ouinet may"
" have encountered some issue while starting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Try to visit some page, if possible one which is usually available. If you "
"get an error like \"Failed to retrieve the resource (after attempting all "
"configured mechanisms)\", CENO may be experiencing some issues with general "
"connectivity (like being unable to join the BitTorrent network). If you are "
"on a mobile connection, try again with Wi-Fi."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you get an error like \"The proxy server is refusing connections\" when "
"visiting the page, try to stop other applications which may be offering some"
" service to the device, then restart CENO."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Technical note:** This may happen if another application is already "
"listening on TCP ports `127.0.0.1:8077` or `127.0.0.1:8078`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accessing some content shows \"Failed to retrieve the resource\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This means that CENO tried all available mechanisms to access the content, "
"but none of them succeeded."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You should make sure that the following requirements are fulfilled for CENO "
"to work:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You are running a recent version of the CENO Browser. Obsolete versions may "
"not be able to communicate with newer injectors or other clients. Check the "
"[installation instructions](install.md) to know where to get new versions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All access mechanisms in the [Settings page](settings.md) are enabled. "
"Otherwise CENO will not be able to circumvent some connectivity issues when "
"accessing content."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Your device has a working connection to the network, i.e. your normal Web "
"browser is able to open some Web sites. CENO and Ouinet cannot work when all"
" network connectivity is shut down (although users may still find a common "
"Wi-Fi access point to do device-to-device sharing)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If that is the case, it is worth explaining what may be happening for all "
"access mechanisms to fail, so that you get an idea of the chances that you "
"have to get content using CENO."
msgstr ""

msgid "Origin access"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Your CENO Browser cannot directly reach the content's origin server. Either "
"the server is having some difficulties itself (e.g. it is down or under some"
" attack), or someone is interfering with your connection to it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the main use case for CENO and the other mechanisms should "
"compensate for it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Proxy/Injector access"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Someone is interfering with your connection to Internet addresses in the "
"injector swarm. Since this is expected to happen eventually as CENO (and "
"Ouinet) gain traction, CENO resorts to reach injectors via other clients "
"acting as bridges."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are different reasons for CENO not to be able to reach such clients:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"No other client is reachable by you. If only a few Ouinet clients are "
"online, it is entirely possible that none of them is in a network which "
"allows it to be reached from the outside. This should become less likely as "
"CENO and Ouinet get popular and more clients with diverse connectivity get "
"online."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The extreme case here is that connections between Ouinet clients are "
"detected as such by a censor and blocked. This is quite unlikely (since it "
"may entail blocking all BitTorrent traffic) and currently beyond what Ouinet"
" supports, but we plan to make it more resistant against these attacks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"No other client can reach an injector. Since it is unlikely that all "
"injectors are simultaneously down, that may mean that you can only reach "
"Ouinet clients which are themselves affected by similar network interference"
" as yours."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This can happen when all traffic leaving or entering the country you are in "
"is interrupted. CENO would resort in this case to getting and using the "
"content from the distributed cache, even if it is stale."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Again, as CENO and Ouinet become more popular, the chances increase that "
"there are at least a few clients that do have some kind of access to "
"international sites. Even if access is precarious, a single Ouinet client "
"able to inject some content into the country could suffice to enable it to "
"spread (over the distributed cache) without further need to access the "
"outside world."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, we do run some Ouinet clients with good connectivity in (hopefully)"
" censorship-free countries to try to avoid those two situations, but please "
"note that clients with such stable Internet addresses could get blocked as "
"well."
msgstr ""

msgid "Distributed cache"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that an absolute requirement to be able to retrieve any content"
" from the distributed cache is that it has already been injected by some "
"other CENO or Ouinet user. This means that popular content is more likely to"
" eventually get injected and replicated in a natural manner, while more "
"obscure content is less so, unless someone takes care of using CENO or some "
"other Ouinet client to inject and keep seeding it (which may further expose "
"them to some [risks](../concepts/risks.md))."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Please note that some content which is not considered safe for sharing will "
"never be injected, no matter how many people retrieve it using public "
"browsing. This includes content marked as private by the origin server, "
"content which requires authentication, and some traffic exchanged by certain"
" dynamic Web applications."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also note that the clients holding copies of injected content need to be "
"reachable by you. The same observations described in the previous point for "
"reaching bridge clients do apply here."
msgstr ""

msgid "Others cannot retrieve content seeded by my device"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, make sure that your device is still seeding the content by going to "
"the [*CENO Settings* page](settings.md), only leaving the *Shared by other "
"CENO users* source box checked, then accessing that content again: it should"
" load (at least partially), and pushing the CENO address bar icon should "
"only show non-zero values under *Shared by other CENO users* or *Shared by "
"you*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the content does not load, it could be that CENO has already removed it, "
"since it automatically cleans up stale content (older than a week by "
"default) from your local cache. Enable the *Via the CENO network (public)* "
"source in the Settings page and access the content again. Please allow a "
"couple of minutes to pass for the device to announce the content in the "
"distributed cache index. Make *Shared by other CENO users* the only checked "
"box again and access the content once more; if it still does not load, it "
"may be that the particular content is not deemed safe for sharing by Ouinet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the previous step works, but another device with only the *Shared by "
"other CENO users* source enabled still shows \"Failed to retrieve the "
"resourceâ€¦\", there are two possible scenarios. If both devices are in the "
"same network (e.g. on the same Wi-Fi access point), it could be that the "
"network does not allow direct communication between devices connected to it."
" This happens in some public Wi-Fi networks, so try using a private one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the devices are in different networks, it could be due to a variety of "
"reasons. One of them is that the network of the first device does not allow "
"incoming connections: if you open its *CENO Settings* page, under "
"*Reachability status* it should say *reachable* or *likely reachable*. "
"Otherwise seeding may not be possible from that network as it is."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Technical note:** If your device reports *undecided* reachability and you "
"can change the configuration of the access point, you may create a permanent"
" port forwarding rule towards your client. See [here](bridging.md) for "
"further instructions."
