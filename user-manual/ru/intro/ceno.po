msgid "What is the CENO Browser?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"CENO (short for [Censorship.no!](https://censorship.no/)) is a Web browser "
"for mobile Android devices (such as smartphones and tablets) that uses a "
"novel approach to circumvent Internet censorship and share retrieved content"
" among all users in a [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-"
"peer) (P2P) fashion. This reduces overall reliance on international network "
"exchanges, and allows frequently requested Web content to persist in the "
"network even during heavy filtering and throttling events."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What sets CENO apart from most other circumvention initiatives is that users"
" can continue to share Web content even when no (or extremely limited) "
"connectivity exists across national borders. CENO is thus built in "
"anticipation of aggressive Internet filtering and the establishment of "
"[national intranets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_intranet) to "
"fence off nations from the Web."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The CENO Browser is built on an adapted version of [Firefox for "
"Android](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/android/), a popular, modern, "
"feature-rich and secure Free/Libre/Open Source browser. CENO extends Firefox"
" with **Ouinet**, the underlying technology allowing it to share content "
"between devices (described in later sections)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Who develops CENO?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *Censorship.no!* project is run by [eQualitie](https://equalit.ie/) in "
"support of Articles 18, 19 and 20 of the [Universal Declaration of Human "
"Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/). CENO and"
" related technologies are developed as Free/Libre/Open Source software "
"([project source](https://github.com/censorship-no/ \"CENO source code "
"repositories\")), allowing anyone to use, study, share and enhance it. "
"Please contact [cenoers@equalit.ie](mailto:cenoers@equalit.ie) in case of "
"doubt or for further information."
msgstr ""

msgid "Who is it for?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"CENO is meant for everyone but is particularly convenient for people "
"interested in Web content that is censored on their network, and those those"
" living in countries where connectivity to the global Internet is spotty, "
"unreliable or expensive. It encourages and enables the sharing of web "
"content among users, creating a decentralized network of peers helping each "
"other."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You do not need to be an advanced computer user or even understand how peer-"
"to-peer networks operate to use CENO. The user experience is akin to "
"operating a standard Web browser (CENO-specific functionality is largely "
"hidden under the hood)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"CENO can, however, generate more Internet traffic than your usual Web "
"browser â€“ since it needs to let other users know what Web content it is "
"sharing to the network, and possibly deliver this content to those who "
"request it. CENO thus relies on moderately good in-country connectivity. We "
"recommend using CENO when connected to Wi-Fi not just to avoid exhausting "
"mobile data limits (should you have them), but also to increase the chances "
"of being able to deliver Web content to other users."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Warning:** *CENO is not an anonymity tool.* In fact, using CENO may allow "
"others to know whether you have accessed or are sharing certain Web content."
" Please take careful consideration of which risks you can assume by using "
"this tool. See the sections on [public vs. private "
"browsing](../concepts/public-private.md) and [risks](../concepts/risks.md) "
"for further information."
