"Because of the many techniques used to overcome connectivity issues, Ceno "
"may become a convenient way for you to get all kinds of Web content. And, as "
"you may have already read in previous sections, whenever you retrieve and "
"seed a page using Ceno Browser, it becomes available to others. There may be "
"some content, however, that you do not wish to share (or you do not want to "
"let others know that you are trying to or did retrieve), and fortunately "
"Ceno can help you in this instance as well."
