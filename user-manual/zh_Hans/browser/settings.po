"CENO Browser allows you to change some Ouinet-specific settings and get "
"information about your client in a simple manner. This should not be needed "

"strategies against network interference, as well as reporting issues with "
"the app."

"**Technical note:** These options are provided by the *CENO Extension*, a "
