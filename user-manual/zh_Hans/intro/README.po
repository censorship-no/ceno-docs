"The Internet and the World Wide Web have become more and more important for "
"people around the world as a source of all kinds of information, and a way "
"to exercise fundamental rights. At the same time, recent years have seen an "
"increase in all kinds of network censorship and other types of network "
"interference (see the reports from [OONI](https://ooni.org/reports/ \"Open "
"Observatory of Network Interference – Research reports\"), [Magma](https://"
"magma.lavafeld.org/publications/ \"Magma publications\"), [Censored Planet]"
"(https://censoredplanet.org/reports \"Censored Planet – Reports\")), both "

"The Web relies on your devices being able to reach special computers called "
"*web servers* (run by content creators, publishers or Internet services "
"providers) that hold the content you want to retrieve, and to do so in a "
"synchronized way - more like having a live chat on the telephone than "
"exchanging some letters. Unfortunately, this requires that the web server "
"you need is connected to the network and has enough available resources to "
"talk to your device at that moment."

"万维网依赖于你的设备能够接触到被称为*网络服务器*的特殊计算机（由内容创作者、"
"出版商或互联网服务提供商运行），这些计算机拥有你想要检索的内容，并且以同步的"
"方式进行——这种方式更像是在电话上进行实时聊天，而不是交换一些信件。然而，这意"
"味着，你所需要的网络服务器必须连接到网络上，并有足够的可用资源在那一刻与你的"

"The advent of *content delivery networks* (or CDNs, like the commercial "
"Akamai and Cloudflare, or the civil society-oriented Deflect) has taken some "
"of the load off these web servers by distributing copies of the content to "
"data centers all over the world, so that it can be closer to your devices "
"and thus faster to reach, while keeping the origin servers protected from "
"direct access. However, currently CDN servers (and thus the organizations "
"that run them) need to be trusted by both the origin server and your "
"devices, and they also need to be reachable at all times."
msgstr ""
"*内容分发网络*（或称CDN，如商业性的Akamai和Cloudflare，或面向民间社会的"
"Deflect）的出现，通过将内容的副本分发到世界各地的数据中心，减轻了这些网络服务"
"器的一些负担，这样数据内容就可以更接近你的设备，从而可以更快获取，同时保持源"
"服务器免受直接访问。然而，目前CDN服务器（以及运行它们的组织）需要得到原服务器"
"和你的设备的信任，而且它们还需要在任何时候都能被联系上。"

"Unfortunately again, there are situations in which general connectivity is "
"scarce (developing countries or underserved, impoverished or rural regions), "
"expensive (with some countries charging more for international traffic) or "
"has been actively blocked by an state player (explicitly or as a result of a "
"general shutdown). In these cases, reaching origin web servers or even CDN "
"servers is difficult or impossible, and your device will not be able to get "
"that content - even if I was somehow able to access it a few hours ago and "
"we're living some streets apart."
msgstr ""
"不幸的是，在有些情况下，总体的连接是稀缺的（发展中国家，或服务不足的贫困或农"
"村地区），昂贵的（一些国家对国际流量收取更多的费用），或已被官方主动封锁（明"
"确的封锁，或因全面关停而导致）。在这些情况下，到达原网络服务器，甚至CDN服务器"
"是困难的或不可能的，你的设备将无法获取这些内容——即使你在几小时前还能够访问，"
"并且你的设备与服务器只隔了几条街。"
