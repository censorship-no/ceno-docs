msgid ""
"Ceno (short for [Censorship.no!][Censorship.no!]) is a Web browser for "
"mobile Android devices (such as smartphones and tablets) that uses a novel "
"approach to circumvent Internet censorship and share retrieved content among "
"all users in a [peer-to-peer][P2P] (P2P) fashion. This reduces overall "
"reliance on international network exchanges, and allows frequently requested "
"Web content to persist in the network even during heavy filtering and "
"throttling events."
msgstr ""

#: intro/ceno.md:block 3 (paragraph)
msgid ""
"What sets Ceno apart from most other circumvention initiatives is that users "
"can continue to share Web content even when no (or extremely limited) "
"connectivity exists across national borders. Ceno is thus built in "
"anticipation of aggressive Internet filtering and the establishment of "
"[national intranets][national intranets] to fence off nations from the Web."

"Ceno Browser is built on an adapted version of [Firefox for Android][Firefox "
"for Android], a popular, modern, feature-rich and secure Free/Libre/Open "
"Source browser. Ceno extends Firefox with **Ouinet**, the underlying "
"technology allowing it to share content between devices (described in later "
"sections)."

"The *Censorship.no!* project is run by [eQualitie][eQualitie] in support of "
"Articles 18, 19 and 20 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights]"

"developed as Free/Libre/Open Source software ([project source](https://"

msgstr ""

#: intro/ceno.md:block 8 (paragraph)
msgid ""
"Ceno is meant for everyone but is particularly convenient for people "
"interested in Web content that is censored on their network, and those those "
"living in countries where connectivity to the global Internet is spotty, "
"unreliable or expensive. It encourages and enables the sharing of web "
"content among users, creating a decentralized network of peers helping each "
"other."

"You do not need to be an advanced computer user or even understand how peer-"
"to-peer networks operate to use Ceno. The user experience is akin to "
"operating a standard Web browser (Ceno-specific functionality is largely "
"hidden under the hood)."
msgstr ""

#: intro/ceno.md:block 10 (paragraph)
msgid ""
"Ceno can, however, generate more Internet traffic than your usual Web "
"browser â€“ since it needs to let other users know what Web content it is "
"sharing to the network, and possibly deliver this content to those who "
"request it. Ceno thus relies on moderately good in-country connectivity. We "
"recommend using Ceno when connected to Wi-Fi not just to avoid exhausting "
"mobile data limits (should you have them), but also to increase the chances "
"of being able to deliver Web content to other users."

"**Warning:** *Ceno is not an anonymity tool.* In fact, using Ceno may allow "
"others to know whether you have accessed or are sharing certain Web content. "
"Please take careful consideration of which risks you can assume by using "
"this tool. See the sections on [public vs. private browsing](../concepts/"
"public-private.md) and [risks](../concepts/risks.md) for further information."
