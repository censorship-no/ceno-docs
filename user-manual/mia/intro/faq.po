"Since Ceno is based on Mozilla Firefox for Android, it provides all the "
"features that are expected from a modern browser. However, its reliance on "
"Ouinet technology for retrieving web content may affect its operation in "
"subtle ways (some of them potentially involving your privacy)."
msgstr ""

#: intro/faq.md:block 6 (paragraph)
msgid ""
"Also, since Ceno and Ouinet are under continuous development, you may "
"experience some instability. That may also mean that backwards-incompatible "
"changes are introduced which require you to uninstall the application or "
"remove stored data (including bookmarks and site settings) before upgrading."

"Although Ceno strives to provide a user experience as similar to normal Web "
"browsing as possible, some of the techniques used to avoid network "
"interference do not play well with such dynamic sites. This is the case with "
"Ceno's default mode of operation (i.e. public browsing), since it strips "
"down all private data (like passwords and cookies) from Web traffic to "
"ensure that it does not leak to other untrusted Ceno or Ouinet users."
msgstr ""

#: intro/faq.md:block 11 (paragraph)
msgid ""
"To avoid this and enable the use of such dynamic sites in Ceno, you can use "
"Personal tabs (i.e. private browsing), which leave private data intact and "
"keep connections to the sites encrypted and thus protected from everyone "
"else. However, this requires that network traffic from your device can reach "
"those websites in some way."

"Ceno is not an anonymity tool. An attacker able to spy on your network "

msgid ""
"Whenever your Ceno Browser serves content to another user or forwards their "
"traffic, it is consuming extra data depending on factors like how popular or "

msgstr ""

#: intro/faq.md:block 27 (paragraph)
msgid ""
"Although Ceno is much lighter in resources than other data-sharing "
"applications, it can still result in increased data usage and fees. We "

"Ceno and Ouinet use various techniques for different users to cooperate in "

"The net result is that Ceno may keep on draining your battery even when not "
