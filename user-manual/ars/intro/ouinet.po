"[Ouinet][Ouinet] is a core technology that allows CENO Browser to share Web "
"content with other devices. Ouinet comes in the form of reusable computer "
"code (a library) that an application like CENO can use to become a "
"participant in a network of cooperating nodes that communicate directly "
"([peer-to-peer][P2P] or P2P) to help access and store new Web content, and "
"to request and deliver previously accessed content to others."

"Ouinet is based on a clever combination and use of existing technologies to "
"accomplish each of its functionalities: locating other participants is done "
"with techniques coming from the world of file-sharing (BitTorrent's "
"distributed hash table), communicating with them uses common Web and file-"
"sharing protocols (HTTP proxy requests and BitTorrent's µTP), and modern "
"industry standards ensure the security of communications and the "
"authenticity of exchanged content (TLS encryption and Ed25519 signatures). "
"Ouinet allows replacing particular technologies with others if needed (for "
"instance, some uses of µTP can be replaced by Tor's Pluggable Transports)."

"On mobile devices, Ouinet can be embedded into end-user applications (as an "
"Android library). In computers, it can be used by normal Web clients like "

"Ouinet is mostly useful for software developers, content creators and "
"publishers who want to enable users of their applications to share retrieved "
"content with other users. This reduces the overall demand on the application "
"server and improves content accessibility for users living in countries that "
"block access to that server."
