# Helping other CENO users browse the Web

A peer-to peer-network is built from every node connected to it (yes, that means you as well!) The more nodes, the stronger and more versatile the network becomes. If you are running the CENO Browser from a country that does not censor the internet (or not as heavily as some), consider helping other CENO users by becoming a **bridge** node. You will then route traffic between clients living in heavily censored countries and our network inectors. You wont be able to see this traffic (it will be sent through an encrypted tunnel) nor will any of this traffic remain on your device. 

# How to become a CENO bridge

This functionality is already built into the CENO browser client. Your phone will need to be connected to a WiFi network that has [UPnP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play) enabled. The CENO Settings menu will indicate the UPnP status of your phone.
