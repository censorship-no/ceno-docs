msgid "Helping other CENO users browse the Web"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A peer-to-peer network is built from every node connected to it (yes, that "
"means you as well). The more nodes, the stronger and more versatile the "
"network becomes. If you are running the CENO Browser from a country that "
"does not censor the Internet (or not as heavily as some), consider helping "
"other CENO users by becoming a **bridge** node. You will then begin to route"
" traffic between clients living in heavily censored countries and CENO "
"injectors. You will not be able to see their traffic (it will be sent "
"through an encrypted tunnel) nor will any of this traffic remain on your "
"device."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Note:** The configuration described in this section may also help your "
"device to effectively seed content to others on the distributed cache, so "
"please consider applying it as well when using CENO in a censoring country "
"(but keep in mind the [risks](../concepts/risks.md) of serving such content "
"to others)."
msgstr ""

msgid "How to become a CENO bridge"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This functionality is already built into the CENO Browser. Your device will "
"need to be connected to a Wi-Fi network that has either UPnP enabled or "
"explicit port forwarding configured for CENO. See the next sections for "
"further details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, please note that Android will only allow a mobile device to act as "
"a proper bridge while you are actively using it, as power-saving features "
"will throttle the operation of CENO otherwise."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Technical note:** This is mainly due to Android's [Doze "
"mode](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-"
"standby \"Android Developers â€“ Optimize for Doze and App Standby\") slowing "
"down the operation of the native Ouinet library. Unfortunately, disabling "
"battery optimization for CENO does not seem to exclude Ouinet from it. Your "
"particular device may also include its own power-saving features which may "
"interfere with CENO; please check [Dont't kill my "
"app!](https://dontkillmyapp.com/) for your device's brand."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Thus if you intend to have CENO acting as a permanent, always-reachable "
"bridge, besides a properly configured Wi-Fi network you will need to:"

msgstr ""

msgid "Have the device's screen on at all times."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One convenient way of doing this without much power consumption and "
"obnoxious, permanent lighting is using Android's screen saver: enable it "
"under *Settings / Display / Screen saver* (or *Daydream* in some versions), "
"pick the *Clock* widget, choose *When to start screen saver* in the menu and"
" select *While charging* or *Either*. A very dimmed down clock will appear "
"on a black background while the device is not active."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Please note that you should not use the power button to lock the device as "
"this will turn the screen off. Instead, just wait for the device to lock "
"itself with the screen on."

msgid ""
"[UPnP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play) is the easiest"
" way of making your CENO Browser reachable to the CENO network. The [CENO "
"Settings](settings.md) page will indicate the UPnP status on your local "
"network."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using port forwarding as an alternative to UPnP"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead of enabling UPnP on your router, you can create a port forwarding "
"rule, to make sure that connections from the CENO network are forwarded to "
"your device. You will need to login to the router's administration interface"
" and locate the *port forwarding* option. To see which IP address you need "
"to forward the connections to and the relevant port, open the *CENO "
"Settings* page and look under the *Local UDP endpoint(s)*."
msgstr ""

msgid "![Figure: Local UDP endpoints](images/udp-port.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The port forwarding must be for the UDP protocol (not TCP). CENO chooses a "
"random port on first run and keeps it for subsequent runs, but your device's"
" local network IP address may change from time to time. Thus you should "
"periodically review the *CENO Settings* page to see that your device is "
"reachable to the CENO network."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Technical note:** Alternatively, you can make sure that the router always "
"assigns the same IP address to your device (e.g. via a static DHCP lease for"
" the device's MAC address)."
