# Public and Personal browsing modes

As described [in a previous section](../concepts/public-personal.md), Ceno has two different modes of operation depending on whether you want to share the content that you browse with others (Public browsing) or not (Personal browsing).

This setting applies *to each tab* that you open in the browser, i.e. you can have Public browsing tabs and Personal browsing tabs.  Ceno's default whenever you start it or open a new tab (via the 'Public Tabs' option on the homepage or the Tabs icon next to the Clear icon in the address bar) is to use Public browsing.  To open a new tab in Personal browsing mode, just choose *Personal Tabs* on the homepage or switch to the Personal mode icon in the Tabs menu.

You can tell public tabs from personal ones because public tabs have a lighter (or white) tool bar:

In contrast, private tabs have a darker tool bar:

Once you have loaded a page in a tab, the Ceno icon in the address bar will help you know how it actually retrieved the different elements of the content.  We will cover this icon later on.
