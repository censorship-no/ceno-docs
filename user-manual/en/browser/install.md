# Installing CENO

The CENO Browser can be installed via the following means:

  - [Google Play][ceno-gplay] (*CENO Browser* from *eQualitie*): the recommended source for most Android users.
  - [GitHub][ceno-gh]: for Android devices without Google Play.
  - [Paskoocheh][ceno-pask]: for users in countries blocking access to the previous channels.

[ceno-gplay]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ie.equalit.ceno
[ceno-gh]: https://github.com/censorship-no/ceno-browser/releases
[ceno-pask]: https://paskoocheh.com/tools/124/android.html

CENO requires *no special permissions* to run.

**Warning:** Please be *extremely skeptical* about installing the CENO Browser from sources other than the ones listed above.  Because of the application's nature, their potential users may become a target for all kinds of fake or manipulated versions used to violate the user's privacy or attack other CENO and Ouinet users.  If in doubt, please contact <cenoers@equalit.ie> before installing a suspicious app.
