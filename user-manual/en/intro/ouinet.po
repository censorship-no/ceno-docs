msgid "What is Ouinet?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"[Ouinet](https://github.com/equalitie/ouinet/) is a core technology that "
"allows the CENO browser to share Web content with other devices. Ouinet "
"comes in the form of reusable computer code (a library) that an application "
"like CENO can use to become a participant in a network of cooperating nodes "
"that communicate directly ([peer-to-"
"peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) or P2P) to help access and"
" store new Web content, and to request and deliver previously accessed "
"content to others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ouinet is based on a clever combination and use of existing technologies to "
"accomplish each of its functionalities: locating other participants is done "
"with techniques coming from the world of file-sharing (BitTorrent's "
"distributed hash table), communicating with them uses common Web and file-"
"sharing protocols (HTTP proxy requests and BitTorrent's µTP), and modern "
"industry standards ensure the security of communications and the "
"authenticity of exchanged content (TLS encryption and Ed25519 signatures). "
"Ouinet allows replacing particular technologies with others if needed (for "
"instance, some uses of µTP can be replaced by Tor's Pluggable Transports)."

"On mobile devices, Ouinet can be embedded into end-user applications (as an "
"Android library). In computers, it can be used by normal Web clients like "
"browsers (as a local HTTP proxy)."

"Same as the CENO Browser, Ouinet is developed by "
"[eQualitie](https://equalit.ie/) as Free/Libre/Open-Source software."
msgstr ""

msgid "Who is it for?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ouinet is mostly useful for software developers, content creators and "
"publishers who want to enable users of their applications to share retrieved"
" content with other users. This reduces the overall demand on the "
"application server and improves content accessibility for users living in "
"countries that block access to that server."

msgid ""
"Please note that Ouinet is still an experimental project: some features may "
"not work reliably enough in certain scenarios, bugs may exist and crashes "
"may occur. We encourage you to reach out to us at "
"[cenoers@equalit.ie](mailto:cenoers@equalit.ie), test it and report back - "
"your feedback is very welcome!"

"**Warning:** *Ouinet is not an anonymity tool*. If you are unsure about its "
"adequacy for a certain task, do not hesitate to contact us."
