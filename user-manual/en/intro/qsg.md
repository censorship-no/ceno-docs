# Quick start guide

The CENO Browser allows you to access any website on the internet, even if it is censored in your country. CENO uses a peer-to-peer infrastructure to route your requests, as well as to store and share retrieved content with others. [Read more](ceno.md).

## How to get started

If you have an Android phone, download the CENO browser from [Google Play][ceno-gplay] or from [GitHub][ceno-gh]. Detailed installation instructions are [here](../browser/install.md).

## Configuration

The CENO Browser is in [BETA][] but it should work out-of-the-box. If you are concerned about privacy or if your requested website is not loading as expected, please see [public vs. private browsing](../concepts/public-private.md).
