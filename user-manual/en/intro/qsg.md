The CENO Browser allows you to access any website on the internet, even if it is censored in your country. CENO uses a peer-to-peer infrastructure to route your requests, as well as to store and share retrieved content with others. [Read more](https://censorship.no/user-manual/en/intro/ceno.html).

# How to get started

If you have an Android phone, download the CENO browser from the [Google playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ie.equalit.ceno&hl=en) or from our [Github page](https://github.com/censorship-no/ceno-browser/releases). Detailed installation instructions are [here](https://censorship.no/user-manual/en/intro/install.html). 

# Configuration

The CENO Browser is in [BETA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#BETA) but it should work out-of-the-box. If you are concerned about privacy or if your requested website is not loading as expected, please see [public vs. private browsing](https://censorship.no/user-manual/en/concepts/public-private.html).
