# What is the CENO Browser?

CENO (short for [Censorship.no!][]) is a Web browser for mobile devices (such as smart phones and tablets) which uses a novel approach to circumvent Internet censorship.  CENO allows to store Web content that the user visited on their device, and later deliver it to other CENO users who are unable to reach the servers of that content, either because of selective blocking or due to general shutdown of international connectivity.  The content is delivered from one device to the other over the network with no CENO-specific intermediaries (the so-called [peer-to-peer][P2P] or P2P fashion).

What sets CENO apart from most other circumvention initiatives is that users can continue to share Web content even when no (or extremely limited) connectivity exists across national borders, as long as it stays reasonably good in-country.  CENO is thus built in expectation of aggressive Internet filtering and the establishment of [national intranets][] to fence off nations from the Web.

CENO is an adapted version of [Firefox for Android][], a popular, modern, feature-rich and secure Free/Libre/Open-Source browser.  CENO extends Firefox with **Ouinet**, the underlying technology allowing it to share content between devices (described in later sections).
