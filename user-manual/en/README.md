# Censorship.no! User Manual

This manual documents the **CENO Browser** and related technologies created by the [Censorship.no!](https://censorship.no/) project, always with final users in mind.  Some technical notes (marked as such) are added for clarification, but they can be safely skipped.

If you are looking for technical documentation (like protocol specifications and implementation details), please refer to the [CENO documentation repository](https://github.com/censorship-no/ceno-docs/), where you will find pointers for further reading.
