msgid "Installing CENO"
msgstr ""

msgid "The CENO Browser can be installed via the following means:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ie.equalit.ceno)"
" (*CENO Browser* from *eQualitie*): the recommended source for most Android "
"users."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"[GitHub](https://github.com/censorship-no/ceno-browser/releases): for "
"Android devices without Google Play."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"[Paskoocheh](https://paskoocheh.com/tools/124/android.html): for users in "
"countries blocking access to the previous channels."
msgstr ""

msgid "CENO requires *no special permissions* to run."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Warning:** Please be *extremely skeptical* about installing the CENO "
"Browser from sources other than the ones listed above. Because of the "
"application's nature, their potential users may become a target for all "
"kinds of fake or manipulated versions used to violate the user's privacy or "
"attack other CENO and Ouinet users. If in doubt, please contact "
"[cenoers@equalit.ie](mailto:cenoers@equalit.ie) before installing a "
"suspicious app."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you run CENO for the first time, you will be presented with a series of"
" screens introducing some features generic to Firefox browsers. Just scroll "
"through them by pressing *NEXT* until you see a *Sign in to Sync* button and"
" a *START BROWSING* link. Firefox Sync has not been tested to work with "
"CENO, so just push *START BROWSING*."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stopping CENO completely"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every time that you start the app a CENO icon will appear on your device's "
"notification bar. This icon represents the *CENO Browser service*, which is "
"the part of CENO that runs permanently (even when you are not browsing) and "
"allows other clients to use your device as a bridge and retrieve content "
"from it at any time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since running such service uses network and processor resources, you may "
"want to stop it whenever you are on the move (i.e. not connected to Wi-Fi or"
" far from a charger). Tapping on the notification attached to the icon will "
"stop both CENO and its service at once (until you open CENO again)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"![Figure: Tap on the notification to stop the CENO service](images/tap-"
"stop.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Purging all CENO data (the \"panic button\")"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *CENO Browser service* notification shown above includes a few "
"accompanying actions which can be triggered by tapping on them. The *Home* "
"action will just open CENO with a new public browsing tab showing its home "
"page. The *Erase* action demands more explanation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Note:** If the actions below the notification are not visible, drag the "
"notification from its center towards the bottom to unfold it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Shall you ever need to quickly stop CENO and clear absolutely all the data "
"related with it (not only cached content but also settings like favorites, "
"passwords and all browsing history), you can tap on *Erase*. To avoid losing"
" your data accidentally, this will not remove anything yet, but just show an"
" additional action for a brief moment, as pictured below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"![Figure: The last action stops CENO and clears all its data](images/tap-"
"purge.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you tap on the *Yes* action, CENO will be stopped and all its data "
"removed *without further questions*, effectively leaving your device as if "
"CENO had never been used."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you do not tap on the action, it will go away in a few seconds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Note:** The method described above requires that CENO is running on your "
"device. To accomplish the same effect when CENO is stopped, you can use "
"Android's general *Settings* page and, under the *Apps* entry, choose CENO "
"and then *Clear data*."
msgstr ""

msgid "As a harsher alternative, you may completely uninstall the app."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Warning:** Android may still keep other traces of having used an app "
"besides its data, for instance in its system log."
