"The Internet and the World Wide Web have become more and more important for "
"people around the world as a source of all kinds of information, and a way "
"to exercise fundamental rights. At the same time, recent years have seen an "
"increase in all kinds of network censorship and other types of network "
"interference (see the reports from [OONI](https://ooni.org/reports/ \"Open "
"Observatory of Network Interference – Research reports\"), [Magma](https://"
"magma.lavafeld.org/publications/ \"Magma publications\"), [Censored Planet]"
"(https://censoredplanet.org/reports \"Censored Planet – Reports\")), both "
"from private and state actors."

"The Web relies on your devices being able to reach special computers called "
"*web servers* (run by content creators, publishers or Internet services "
"providers) that hold the content you want to retrieve, and to do so in a "
"synchronized way - more like having a live chat on the telephone than "
"exchanging some letters. Unfortunately, this requires that the web server "
"you need is connected to the network and has enough available resources to "
"talk to your device at that moment."

"The advent of *content delivery networks* (or CDNs, like the commercial "
"Akamai and Cloudflare, or the civil society-oriented Deflect) has taken some "
"of the load off these web servers by distributing copies of the content to "
"data centers all over the world, so that it can be closer to your devices "
"and thus faster to reach, while keeping the origin servers protected from "
"direct access. However, currently CDN servers (and thus the organizations "
"that run them) need to be trusted by both the origin server and your "
"devices, and they also need to be reachable at all times."

"Unfortunately again, there are situations in which general connectivity is "
"scarce (developing countries or underserved, impoverished or rural regions), "
"expensive (with some countries charging more for international traffic) or "
"has been actively blocked by an state player (explicitly or as a result of a "
"general shutdown). In these cases, reaching origin web servers or even CDN "
"servers is difficult or impossible, and your device will not be able to get "
"that content - even if I was somehow able to access it a few hours ago and "
"we're living some streets apart."
