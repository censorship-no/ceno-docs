"Hopefully not. As mentioned above, Ceno Browser tries hard to remove any "
"private data (passwords, cookiesâ€¦) from any request for injection. In "
"addition, the injector does not itself do any seeding; in fact, its sole "
"purpose is to sign content so that Ouinet clients can seed it. This means "
"that when the content comes back to the client, it is further analyzed, and "
"if the origin server indicated that it is of a private nature, Ceno will not "
"seed it either."

"Still, there could be cases of badly designed or malicious pages which may "

"normal path components (e.g. `http://example.com/subscribe/you@example."
