msgid "Annex: The Ouinet client front-end"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Ouinet client (as run by e.g. the CENO Browser) offers a front-end page "
"with some information and actions which may be useful for debugging the "
"client. Some of those may not be available from the CENO Extension."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The front-end is accessible using any plain Web browser running on the same "
"device (you can use CENO too). Its default address is "
"[http://127.0.0.1:8078/](http://127.0.0.1:8078/). If you open it, you will "
"see something like the figure below."

msgid "The items shown in the page include:"
msgstr "စာမျက်နှာတွင် ပြသထားသော အကြောင်းအရာများတွင် အောက်ပါတို့ ပါဝင်သည်-"

msgid ""
"A link to enable the client as a certificate authority (CA) at your browser,"
" since the client needs to intercept HTTPS traffic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You only need this to use a plain browser for testing the Ouinet client, in "
"which case you will also have to configure its HTTP/HTTPS proxies to "
"`127.0.0.1:8077`, and manually enable the [CENO "
"Extension](https://github.com/censorship-no/ceno-ext-settings/) for "
"injection to work. We very strongly recommend using a *separate, specific "
"browser profile* for this purpose."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Please note that none of this needs to be done for the CENO Browser, since "
"it is already configured like that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Buttons to enable or disable the different mechanisms used by the client to "
"access content. They are equivalent to the check boxes in the [*CENO "
"Settings* page](../browser/settings.md)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Selectors to choose different log levels, like the default `INFO` "
"(informational messages, warnings and errors) or `DEBUG` (verbose output "
"useful for reporting errors)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The public key used to verify signatures from injectors, and the configured "
"way to reach them. The default `bep5` method looks up Internet addresses in "
"a BitTorrent injector swarm, as explained [here](../concepts/how.md)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Information on your local cache like the maximum accepted age of cached "
"content, the approximate size of the cache, and a button to purge it "
"completely."
