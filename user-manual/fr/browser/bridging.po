"A peer-to-peer network is built from every node connected to it (yes, that "
"means you as well!). The more nodes, the stronger and more versatile the "
"network becomes. If you are running CENO Browser from a country that does "
"not censor the Internet (or not as heavily as some), consider helping other "
"CENO users by becoming a **bridge** node. You will then begin to route "
"traffic between clients living in heavily censored countries and CENO "
"injectors. You will not be able to see their traffic (it will be sent "
"through an encrypted tunnel), nor will any of this traffic remain on your "
"device."

"pays qui ne pratique pas la censure sur Internet (ou dans une moindre mesure "
"que certains), vous pouvez à aider les autres utilisateurs de CENO en "
