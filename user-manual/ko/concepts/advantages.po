"The main advantages of using CENO and Ouinet over other circumvention "
"technologies stem from the cooperation of clients and injectors to forward "
"traffic for one another, sign content for later verification, and store "
"signed content for seeding to others. Some advantages worth mentioning are:"

"**Familiar usage:** Accessing Web content using CENO Browser feels quite "
"like surfing the Web on your habitual browser, even during complete "
"blocking. There is no need for new custom links to popular content, or "
"special actions from the user (like transferring files between applications)."

"**Increased availability of content:** Ouinet is able to provide content in "
"an efficient and trusted manner in situations of extreme network "
"interference. The more popular some particular content gets, the more copies "
"of it get seeded by CENO/Ouinet clients, and the more available it becomes."

"Signed content may be brought into particular clients in a disconnected area "
"over offline means (e.g. a USB drive) and thus made available to other "
"clients."

"**Faster browsing:** Since your client can retrieve different parts of the "
"same content from various clients at the same time, the load of delivering "
"the content is distributed among different networks and devices, thus "
"avoiding clogging the paths to a single client (especially when delivering a "
"big resource like a video). This is not only useful when infrastructure "
"connecting to other countries is limited, but also for publishers to avoid "
"resource usage spikes at origin servers when some of their content becomes "
"very popular (the so-called [Slashdot effect][Slashdot effect])."

"**Cheaper browsing:** Content popular in a particular region tends to get "
"copied in CENO/Ouinet clients in that region, even if the origin server is "
"abroad. If you are interested in that content, your client will probably get "
"it from some other client in your region. In some countries where "
"international traffic is more expensive than local one (e.g. in the presence "
"of a [national intranet][National intranet]), this can actually save you "
"money."
